        I dunno what to write about this place lmao.
        It is broken up into four sections.
        First on the outside there is the area consisting the farms, where most peasants live.
        A wall seperates this from the second, where most people in the kingdom live.
        Area two is mostly houses and shops, and many peasants flow in and out of the area, setting up stalls to sell their goods.
        Once again, there is a wall separating area two from area three, where most of the nobles live.
        This area basically only consists of houses, and the nobles living in this area usually send out servants if they want to, say, purchase something.
        Lastly, there is another wall between area three, and area four, the castle.
        Area four is only populated by a few people.
        There is the king and his close family, a relatively large force of guards, the king's servants and advisors, and the criminals placed in the dungeon below.
        I think that's it?
        Let me know if I missed anything.
