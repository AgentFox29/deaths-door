        Party started in a tavern.
        Everyone in the party was familiar with the bartender in their own ways.
        Bartender was eventually dragged out of the tavern and arrested for treason.
        Party followed the guards.
        Party was met with a wall protected by two guards and one more on the other side of the wall.
        After some failed attempts at getting through the wall, party engages in combat and kills all three guards.
        Reach yet another wall with the same predicament.
        Poink flies over the wall and kills the guard on the other side.
        Other two guards run in fear when Poink opens the door.
        Party sneaks into the castle through a watchtower.
        While attempting to avoid yet more fights, party comes across a regular bedroom, and another room which is completely empty with nothing except a wall completely covered in runes.
        Party then encounters a door leading down to the dungeons that requires the king's staff to open.
        They also find a door leading up that requires a regular key to open.
        Party enters the guard room and begin combat.
        Upon killing all the guards and exploring a bit more into the room, they find the key inside a painting in the wall.
        Party heads back to the door leading up and unlock it.
